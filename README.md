# Creode Tech Test - Social Media API's

## Introduction

You should not spend many hours on this and don’t worry if you don’t manage to complete it, just send over what you have. We’d like to see your solution with well thought out, clean code focusing on readability and reusability.

## Brief

The aim of this task is to pull data from one of the mock service classes, with the ability to easily switch to using the other one. Both mocks are intended to be simple libraries which talk to a Social Media API.

### CBook API Mock Library
The CBook API uses an approach which requires:

 - A client_id (**`8XWr1Hp5xbhSM6u0`**)
 - A client_secret (**`07xdHM9OA8ULaBeC`**)

### Critter API Mock Library
The Critter API requires just an API key for authentication:

 - An API Key (**`j4nHNuaPo2nq6AdW`**)

### Outputting the Response
The final output of this implementation will be a page showing the following data:

 - Follower/Friend Name
 - Follower/Friend Photo
 - Follower/Friend Description
 - Follower/Friend Count
 - Follower/Friend Email Address

This doesn’t have to look pretty (it isn’t a design test). The main goal is to be able to swap between the Mock API’s, changing the smallest amount of code you can and organise the code in a way that is both performant and adaptable.

## Deliverables

 - An archived git repository showing commit history
 - Any instructions to get the code running
 - A brief write-up of any decisions you made (and why!) and details of any bits you didn't manage to add within the 2 hours time but you'd like to.

All the deliverables should be emailed to guy.weston@creode.co.uk once you have finished.
